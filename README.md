Do you want to save game in a specific moment but the
title does not allow to do it, e.g. Diablo with option Save
and Exit? Use this script, save this moment, and use replace
option, if you want to go back to it!

Instructions:

Write the full path of a save game directory in path.txt
(by default there is my local path for They Are Billions)

Always close game before using this script

Menu options:

Save - Store your current save data

Replace - Go back to your progress to a moment saved by this
script

Delete - Remove progress saved by this script
